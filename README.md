# Car_dealer
#A network implementation of blockchain to monitor/manage transactions that exchanged vehicles for cash in a secure manner

#Logic
*Buyer sends a request to DMV with the sellerâ€™s id and the money required for the purchase.

*DMV finds the seller and request the car from that seller.

*Once DMV has both money and car, it then sends the items to the respected nodes

*DMV sends the money to the seller

*DMV sends the car to the buyer

*Then we check if the buyer received the car and then check if the seller received the money

*Once this is done, the DMV mines the new block with the owner and the car and adds it to the Blockchain
