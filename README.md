# Logic <h1>

* Buyer sends a request to DMV with the sellerâ€™s id and the money required for the purchase.

* DMV finds the seller and request the car from that seller.

* Once DMV has both money and car, it then sends the items to the respected nodes

* DMV sends the money to the seller

* DMV sends the car to the buyer

* Then we check if the buyer received the car and then check if the seller received the money

* Once this is done, the DMV mines the new block with the owner and the car and adds it to the Blockchain
